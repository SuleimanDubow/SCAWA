<p>Somali Children and Women Advocacy (SCAWA) is an independent, non-governmental, non-profit, and non-political organization established to advocate for the protection of human rights and to improve the lives of the most vulnerable, poorest, and marginalized families affected by poverty and crises. Founded on Tuesday, July 22, 2014, in Kismayu, Jubbaland State, Gedo region, Somalia. SCAWA aims to eradicate poverty and empower women and children to reach their full potential.

  <br><br>Since its inception, SCAWA has partnered with various international and local organizations including UNDP, UNOPS/Cities Alliance, United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM), FCG Sweden, Amplify Change, Global Green Grants USA, Oxfam Novib, Front Line Human Rights Defenders, Child Youth Finance International (CYFI), and No FGM Australia. SCAWA is also an active member of prominent networks such as The Girl Generation, Women Thrive, Girls Not Brides, Africa GBV Prevention Network, Global Climate Change and Health Alliance (GCHA), and STOP KILLER ROBOTS. It serves as Somalia's ambassador-at-large for women and children and actively participates in Education, Protection, Food Security (FSC), and WASH clusters.
  
  <br><br>SCAWA operates with clear-cut internal policies and procedures encompassing financial management, human resources, and procurement, ensuring transparency and accountability in its project implementations. The organization employs a community participatory approach to foster sustainable development and resilience among the communities it serves.
  
  <br><br>Governance within SCAWA is structured with distinct roles and responsibilities. The Board of Directors (BoD) serves as the governing body, responsible for establishing SCAWA's mission, direction, policies, and overseeing fiscal management. The Executive Committee implements the strategic plans approved by the BoD, supervises staff, and manages day-to-day operations. Both committees operate under the clear guidelines set forth in SCAWA's charter and bylaws.
  
  <br><br>SCAWA's mission is rooted in protecting human rights, building resilience, and creating lasting solutions to hunger, extreme poverty, illiteracy, and inequality. Through its holistic approach, SCAWA strives to empower women and children, ensuring they have the necessary resources and opportunities to thrive and contribute positively to their communities.</p>

            
            <p>SCAWA (Somali Children and Women Advocacy) is committed to advocating for the rights and welfare of women and children in Somalia. We work tirelessly to improve their lives through education, healthcare, and empowerment programs. Our mission is to create a safe, healthy, and equitable environment for the most vulnerable communities.</p>

                    <p><br>We believe in the power of community-driven solutions and work closely with local stakeholders to ensure our initiatives are sustainable and impactful. Through our efforts, we aim to eradicate poverty, provide access to quality education and healthcare, and empower women and children to achieve their full potential.</p>

                    <p><br>Founded on the principles of compassion, integrity, and dedication, SCAWA has been at the forefront of social change in Somalia. Our dedicated team of professionals and volunteers works on the ground to deliver programs that address immediate needs and create long-term solutions. We collaborate with international partners, local organizations, and community leaders to maximize our impact and reach.</p>

                    <p><br><i><strong>Our key areas of focus include:</strong></i></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><br><strong>Education:</strong> We provide educational opportunities for children and women, including literacy programs, vocational training, and scholarships. Our goal is to ensure that every individual has the knowledge and skills necessary to lead a productive life.</li>
                        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Access to healthcare is a fundamental right. We run health clinics, mobile medical units, and health education campaigns to ensure that women and children receive the medical attention they need.</li>
                        <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Empowering women is essential for the development of any community. We offer programs that support womenâ€™s economic independence, leadership skills, and participation in decision-making processes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protection:</strong> We advocate for the protection of women and children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. Our services include legal assistance, counseling, and safe shelters for those in need.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Our impact is measured not only by the number of people we reach but by the lasting changes we create in their lives. We are proud of our achievements and remain dedicated to expanding our efforts to reach even more communities in need.</p>
